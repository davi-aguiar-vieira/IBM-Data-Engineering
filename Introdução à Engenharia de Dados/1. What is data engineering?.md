# What is data engineering?

## "The constant increase in data processing speeds and bandwidth, the nostop invention of new tools for creating, shating, and consuming data, and the steady addition of new data creator and consumers around the world, ensure that data growth continues unabated. Data begets more data in a constant virtuous cycle."  Forbes 2020 Report.

**Data Engineering** involves the tasks of designing, building, and maintaining data infrastructures and platforms. These data infrastructures can include databases, Big Data repositories, as well as data pipelines for transforming and moving data between these systems.

## Responsabilities of a Data Engineer
1. Extract, organize and integrate data from disparate sources
2. Prepare data for analysis and reporting by transforming and cleansing it
3. Design and manage data pipelines that encompass the journey of data from source to destination systems
4. Setup and manage the infrastructure required for the ingestion, processing and storage of data (Data Platforms, Data Stores, Distributed Systems, Data Repositories)
