# Layers
- **Data ingestion**: Responsible for bringing data from source systems to the data platform
- **Data storage and integration**: Responsible for storing and merging the extracted data
- **Data processing**: Responsible for validating, transforming and applying business rules to data
- **Analytics and user interface**: Responsible for providing processed data to data consumers
- **Data pipeline**: Responsible for implementing and maintaining a continuous flow data pipeline

# SQL Functions
- **Counting**:
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
    ```
    > returns the number of rows in the `table_name`

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
    ```
    > returns the desired `column_name` without duplicate values 

    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) FROM table_name;
    ```
    > returns the number of rows of the desired `column_name` without duplicate values

- **Aggregation**:
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(column_name) AS sum_all FROM table_name;
    ```
    > returns the sum of a numeric `column_name`


    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(column_name) AS avg_all FROM table_name;
    ```
    > returns the average value of a numeric `column_name`

    ```sql
    SELECT STDDEV(column_name) AS stddev_all FROM table_name;
    ```
    > returns the standard deviation to see how spread out the numeric `column_name` is

    ```sql
    SELECT MAX(column_name) AS max_all FROM table_name;
    ```
    > returns the maximum value in a `column_name`

    ```sql
    SELECT MIN(column_name) AS min_all FROM table_name;
    ```
    > returns the minimum value in a `column_name`

- **Slicing Data**:
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name 
    FROM table_name 
    WHERE column_name_2 IN ('value1', 'value2');
    ```
    > returns the values from a specified column in a table, but only for the rows where another column matches one or more specified values from a given list.

- **Sorting Data**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM table_name order by column_name;
    ```   
    > returns the sorting data set on the desired column
- **Filtering Patterns**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'value%';
    ```  
    > returns all columns (*) from the table_name where the column_name starts with a specified value

- **Grouping Data**
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(column_name) AS alias_name, another_column FROM table_name GROUP BY another_column;
    ```
    
    > returns the sum of column_name for each unique value in another_column grouped by another_column
