- Extracting data from disparate sources
- Architecting and managing data pipelines for transformtaions, integration and storage of data
- Architecting and managing data repositories
- Automating and optimizing workflows and flow of data between systems
- Developing applications needed through the data engineering workflow

## Structure of data
- **Structure data**: data that is well rganized in formats that can be stores in databases and lends itself to standard data analysis methods and tools
- **Semi-structured data**: data that is somewhat organized and relies on meta tags for grouping and hierarchy
- **Unstructured data**: data that is not conventionally organized in the form of rows and columns in a particular format
