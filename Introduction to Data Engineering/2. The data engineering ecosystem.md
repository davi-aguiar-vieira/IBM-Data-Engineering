# Data Engineer's ecoystem

## Includes the infrastructure, tools, frameworks and processes for:
- Extracting data from disparate sources
- Architecting and managing data pipelines for transformtaions, integration and storage of data
- Architecting and managing data repositories
- Automating and optimizing workflows and flow of data between systems
- Developing applications needed through the data engineering workflow

## Structure of data
- **Structured data**: data that is well organized in formats that can be stored in databases and lends itself to standard data analysis methods and tools
- **Semi-structured data**: data that is somewhat organized and relies on meta tags for grouping and hierarchy
- **Unstructured data**: data that is not conventionally organized in the form of rows and columns in a particular format

## Common sources of data
- Relational Databases
- Flat files and XML Databases
- APIs and Web Services
- Web Scraping
- Data Streams and Feeds

# Data repositories
- Databases
- Data Warehouses
- Big Data Stores

### Databases
- Collections of data for input, storage, search, retrival and modifications of data.

#### Relacional Databases
- Data is organized into a tabular format with rows and columns
- Well-defined structure and schema
- Optimized for data operations and querying
- Use SQL as the standard querying language

#### Non-Relaacional Databases
- Emerged in response to the volume, diversity and speed at which data is being generated today
- Built for speed, flexibility and scale
- Data can be stored in a schema-less form
- Widely used for processing big data

---

### Data Warehouse 
- Consolidates data through the extract, transform and load process

---

### Big Data Stores
- Distributed computational and storage infrastructure to store, scale and process very large data sets
